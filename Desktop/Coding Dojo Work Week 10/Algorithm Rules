Algorithm Rules

1. Setup Array (set the facts or equals to so you have the info.)
2. Note Beginning of Array
3. Note ending of Array
4. Travel the Array
5. Do the Work
6. Increment Loop
7. Go to top of Loop

Statement of Problem:
Count the items in the array that are greater than 3 [1, 3, 5, 7]

1)	set array to be [1, 3, 5, 7]
2)	set pos is 0
3)	set end is count(array)
4)	set counter equal to 0
5)	set value to 3 (as a placeholder for 3
6)	if (pos < end) do {
7)	   array[pos] > value {
8)	      counter = counter + 1 (in this case, this is saving the amount of true in statement)
9)	   }
10)	   pos = pos + 1
11)	   Go to step 6
12)	}
13) print counter

Make sure to check your function. Run through code to make sure it runs correctly.

Name		Value
------------------
Array[0]	1
Array[1]	3
Array[2]	5
Array[3]	7
value 		3
counter		0	1 	2
pos			0	1 	2	3	4
end 		4
