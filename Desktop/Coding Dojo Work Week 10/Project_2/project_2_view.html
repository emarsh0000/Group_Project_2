	<div>
		<p>Welcome my brave questors! To the best text adventure game!

		<br><br> Welcome to the land of Vespera. A dangeous and fun place where dragons, giants, and other magical beings can be found. 

		<br><br>

		Your Mission:(should you choose to accept,) is to find your way through these magical lands, to the fortified castle of Lockslyte and defeat the evil magician Lucien, who is holding the royal family hostage.

		<br><br>

		The Rules:

		<br><br>

		1. You type actions to try and progress along the game. For example, you can use LOOK to look around wherever you are. You can TAKE objects sometimes that you find and USE them later. (For example, you see an ax so you type in: TAKE AX to see if you can take it.)<br><br>

		2. Here are some action commands that are allowed:

		<br><br>
		
		USE <br>
		TAKE <br>
		LOOK <br>
		TALK <br>
		OPEN <br><br>

		There are more, but these should get you and your imagination going.<br><br>

		Good Luck! And don't die!
